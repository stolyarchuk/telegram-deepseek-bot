# Telegram Business Features Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of Telegram Business features for the telegram-deepseek-bot. The implementation provides a compatibility layer that works with the current Go Telegram Bot API library (v5.5.1) which does not yet have native support for business features.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Business Update Handling

The bot can handle business-related updates through a compatibility layer:

- **Business Connections**: Simulated connection establishment and management
- **Business Messages**: Processing of messages from business accounts
- **Business Message Editing**: Handling edited business messages
- **Business Message Deletion**: Cleanup of deleted business messages

### 2. Business Commands

The following business commands are available:

- `/business` - Main business command with interactive menu
- `/business_help` - Show help information
- `/business_status` - Check connection status
- `/business_setup` - Interactive setup wizard

### 3. Interactive Configuration

Callback-based configuration system with inline keyboards:

- **Business Help**: Command lists and documentation
- **Business Status**: Connection status and statistics
- **Business Setup**: Configuration wizard with options for:
  - Auto-reply settings
  - Language preferences
  - AI model selection
  - Business hours configuration
  - Customer interaction settings

### 4. Compatibility Layer

Since the current Telegram Bot API library doesn't support business features natively, the implementation includes:

#### Custom Structs

```go
type BusinessConnection struct {
    ID              string
    User            *tgbotapi.User
    UserChatID      int64
    Date            int
    CanReply        bool
    IsEnabled       bool
}

type BusinessMessage struct {
    BusinessConnectionID string
    Message             *tgbotapi.Message
}

type BusinessMessagesDeleted struct {
    BusinessConnectionID string
    Chat                *tgbotapi.Chat
    MessageIDs          []int
}
```

#### Helper Functions

- `storeBusinessConnection()` - Store business connection info
- `isValidBusinessConnection()` - Validate connection
- `sendBusinessConnectionWelcome()` - Send welcome message
- `sendBusinessMessage()` - Send message via business account
- `editBusinessMessage()` - Edit business message
- `isBusinessMessage()` - Check if message is from business

## Implementation Details

### Integration Points

1. **Main Update Handler**: Business updates are processed first in the main robot loop
2. **Callback Query Handler**: Extended to support business configuration callbacks
3. **Command Processing**: Business commands integrated into main command flow

### Message Processing Flow

1. **Update Received**: Check if business-related using `handleBusinessUpdates()`
2. **Business Detection**: Identify business messages/commands
3. **Processing**: Route to appropriate business handler
4. **Response**: Send response with business context indicator
5. **Compatibility**: Prepend business indicator to messages in compatibility mode

### Error Handling

- Graceful fallback for unsupported features
- Logging for business operations
- User feedback for configuration errors

## Usage Examples

### Basic Business Command

```bash
/business
```

Shows main business menu with options for help, status, and setup.

### Status Check

```bash
/business_status
```

Displays current business connection status and statistics.

### Interactive Setup

```bash
/business_setup
```

Launches configuration wizard with inline keyboard options.

## Limitations

1. **API Compatibility**: Features are simulated until native API support is available
2. **Connection Storage**: Uses in-memory storage (not persistent across restarts)
3. **Message Indicators**: Business messages are marked with prefixes in compatibility mode

## Future Improvements

When the Go Telegram Bot API library adds native business support:

1. Replace compatibility structs with native types
2. Update all business handlers to use real business fields
3. Remove compatibility layer indicators
4. Add persistent storage for business connections
5. Implement advanced business features like:
   - Business intro messages
   - Business hours automation
   - Advanced customer management

## Technical Notes

- All business logic is contained in `robot/robot.go`
- Compatibility mode is clearly marked with comments
- Code is structured for easy migration to native API support
- Error handling includes both compatibility and future native modes

## Dependencies

No additional dependencies required. The implementation uses:

- Standard Go Telegram Bot API library (v5.5.1)
- Existing bot infrastructure (logging, i18n, utilities)
- Built-in Go libraries for data structures and processing
